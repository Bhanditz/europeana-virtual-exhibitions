# Exhibitions data structure

Since we will be using the Europeana styleguide ruby gem in the Virtual Exhibitions app (VE for short) we need to create a mapping from the Alchemy CMS to a struture that can be used by Mustache templates. This document will briefly outline some guiding principles for this mapping.

## Page > Elements > Essences

In Alchemy a [*page*](http://guides.alchemy-cms.com/edge/pages.html) consists of one or more [*elements*](http://guides.alchemy-cms.com/edge/elements.html), each element is composed of one or more [*essences*](http://guides.alchemy-cms.com/edge/essences.html).

In the VE app a number of elements will be used, examples are:
* an image
* text
* quote
* full_width_image

Elements are defined in a simple YAML file that can be found in */config/alchemy/elements.yml*. Documentation about elements can be found here: http://guides.alchemy-cms.com/edge/elements.html

Below you will find some examples of how an element is defined and how it is mapped to mustache.

## Example 1 - a text element
### elements.yml

```yaml
- name: text
  hint: false
  unique: false
  contents:
  - name: body
    type: EssenceRichtext
```

### mapped to mustache
```json
{
    "type" : "text",
    "is_text" : true,
    "is_image" : false,
    "body" : {
        "html" : "<p>Text formatted</p>",
        "text" : "Text formatted"
    }
}
```

## Example 2 - an image element

### elements.yml
```yaml
- name: image
  hint: false
  unique: false
  contents:
  - name: image
    type: EssencePicture
  - name: title
    type: EssenceText
```

### mapped to mustache
```json
{
    "type" : "true",
    "is_text" : false,
    "is_image" : true,
    "title" : "Plain text title",
    "image" : {
        "versions" :
        {
            "thumbnail" : {
                "url" : "http://www.seemyimagehere.com/image.jpg"
            },
            "thumbnail" : {
                "url" : "http://www.seemyimagehere.com/image.jpg"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## How to render an element is mustache?

As you can see in the example above an element of the type *image* has five attributes:
- type
- is_text
- is_image
- title
- image


### Attributes starting with is_
Attributes starting with *is_* are just helper attributes that we need in mustache since there is no logic. These can be used in the templates to switch between different ways of rendering an element.

```mustache

{{#elements.present}}
    {{#elements.items}}
        {{#is_text}}
            // render text element
        {{/is_text}}

        {{#is_image}}
            // render image element
        {{is_image}}
    {{/elements.items}}
{{/elements.present}}
```

### Other attributes

As can be seen the other attributes of the image object correspond to names used in the *contents* part of the definition in the elements.yml file. As a rule of thumb you can expect an element of the type image to have at the very least an attribute for each item listed under *contents*.

In the case of an image element there are two attributes: image and title. The *image* attribute refers to an EssencePicture and the *title* attribute refers to an EssenceText.

## Essence mapping

Every Alchemy *essence* will be mapped to a regular ruby used that will be used in the mustache templates.

Below you will find an example mapping for each of the essences used in the VE app. More will be added when needed.
